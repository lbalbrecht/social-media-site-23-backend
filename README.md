# Unnamed Social Media Site

## Proposal

Are you sick of the relentless algorithms of social media? Do you wish you could see the posts that you WANT to see, rather than the posts an AI thinks you SHOULD see? Well, at [Name Pending] we understand and feel your frustration. We, too, long for the days when social media was about exploration and discovery rather than being spoon-fed the most finely curated content available; when content creation was about ingenuity, innovation, and inspiration, rather than a relentless clamor for visibility. At [Name Pending], you can return to the early days of social media, where what you see is what you CHOOSE to see.
